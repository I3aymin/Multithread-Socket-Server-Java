# Multithread-Socket-Server-Java
The project locally hosts a multi threaded socket server that utilizes a Client and Worker class to read server and client messages.

There are multiple classes such as the server, client, and worker classes. For the project to work the user must start up the server and then run the client class to enact any methods or just to read/sent the messages between the client and server.
